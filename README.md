[![Build Status][travis_build_status_badge]][travis_build_status]

This is the working tree from which I generate [my developer blog](https://heredocs.com).

## Page theme

You should recognize it as [Github's take](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) on Jason Costello's [Slate theme](https://github.com/jasoncostello/slate).

My enhancements include:

- a responsive navigation bar courtesy of Bootstrap 4
- a blog-focused homepage

## License
