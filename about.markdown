##### [Stackpole International &ndash; Quality Tags Technology Stack Upgrade](https://stackpole-qtags-dev.herokuapp.com)

Full-stack upgrade of the quality issues reporting system used at [Stackpole International](https://www.stackpole.com)'s Stratford, Ontario location. Their legacy system was backed by Microsoft Access, with a frontend entirely in VBA. We migrated the database to MySQL and redesigned the frontend as an MVC web app using ASP.NET Core and EF 3.1
