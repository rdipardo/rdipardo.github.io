## Some projects I've worked on

### [lexilla](https://www.scintilla.org/LexillaHistory.html)

A library of language lexers for use with the [Scintilla](https://www.scintilla.org)
source code editing component. I wrote and maintain the [lexer for F#][].

### [vim-cpywrite](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5888)

A (Neo)vim plugin to generate a copyright header from the open source license of your choice

### [tidy_json](https://rubygems.org/gems/tidy_json)

A Ruby mixin providing JSON serialization and pretty printing

### [Stackpole International &ndash; Quality Tags Technology Stack Upgrade](https://stackpole-qtags-dev.herokuapp.com)

Full-stack upgrade of the quality issues reporting system used at [Stackpole International](https://www.stackpole.com)'s Stratford, Ontario location. Their legacy system was backed by Microsoft Access, with a frontend entirely in VBA. We migrated the database to MySQL and redesigned the frontend as an MVC web app using ASP.NET Core and EF 3.1
